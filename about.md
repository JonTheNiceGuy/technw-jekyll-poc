Tech Events North West is a group of all the tech event organisers in and around the North West. Events are all grass-roots, community focused. Behind the scenes we work together to support each other, improve our events for the good of the community, and try to cross-pollinate (that bee theme!).

A side effect of us getting together is a shared google calendar and event directory. We all work hard to keep the information of our own events up to date.

Please get in touch if you want to join us!
