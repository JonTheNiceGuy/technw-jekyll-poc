    A group for fans and users of Free and Open Source software. We meet
    once a month to for presentations, discussions, social events and even the occasional
    bit of hardware hacking or computer support. There is no level of technical expertise
    required to attend LivLUG and we pride ourselves on being open and friendly to
    all.
