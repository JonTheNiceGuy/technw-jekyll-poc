    Manchester Tech Nights is a meetup aimed at Manchester's technology
    community, either the people who are making Manchester's tech scene what it is,
    or just those who are interested and want to keep up-to-date. We want to find
    out what's going on across the north west, regardless of language. The night kicks
    off with a headline talk, followed by a series of shorter lightning talks and
    then an informal chat between attendees.
